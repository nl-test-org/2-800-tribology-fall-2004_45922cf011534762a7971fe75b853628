Readings will come from a set of assigned papers and from chapters in the course textbook.

Assigned Papers
---------------

These readings are assigned as examples of research publications in the field, and will be discussed in class.

Lim, S. C., and M. F. Ashby. "Wear-Mechanism Maps." _Acta Metal_ 35, no. 1 (1987): 1-24.

Rha, J. J., S. C. Kwon, J. R. Cho, W. Yim Shon, and N. Saka. "Creation of Ultra-Low Friction and Wear Surfaces for Micro-Devices Using Carbon Films." ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/readings/ultra_low_fricti))

Suh, N. P., and S. T. Oktay. "Wear Debris Formation and Agglomeration." _Journal of Tribology_ 114 (April 1992): 379-393.

Textbook Readings
-----------------

The readings in this table are from the course textbook: Suh, N. P. _Tribophysics_. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1986. ISBN: 9780139309830. Students also read sections of Prof. Suh's new book manuscript on tribology.
